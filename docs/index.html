<p>Dear TLC Supporters and Patrons,</p>
<p>The Local Collaborative’s recent appeals to accept SNAP/EBT benefits (formerly known as food stamps) has been officially denied by the USDA. Since we are currently not achieving our mission of making healthy, local foods accessible to ALL Nashvillians, we are taking a step back and suspending our online sales until we can find a solution.</p>
<p>Please continue to follow our journey on social media as we work towards increasing food access and food justice in our great city, and continue to support our amazing suppliers as they fortify our local food system.</p>
<p>With gratitude and love,</p>
<p>Ashley and Steve</p>
